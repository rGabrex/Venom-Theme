## Introduction ‚úçÔ∏è
I'm rGabrex and this is my first Discord theme. As I am still learning CSS the code may be messy nad there might be (hopefully not) some issues. Please, if you want to help me get better or anything else, reach me on Discord or any other platform and don't esitate to write me!


## Installing ‚öôÔ∏è
**Please Note** that I haven't worked with any plugin, so there's a chance some of them might create a conflict with the theme. If this happens, you can reach me on Discord or any other
platform and I will fix the issue as soon as possible.

**BetterDiscord:**
Go to [BetterDiscord Website](https://betterdiscord.app) and download the theme.
Then move it to the correct folder:
- `%appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes`


## Customizing üìù
If you wish to make any modification to the theme, open the css either in a code editor software (like _VisualStudioCode_).
You will then see the variables I used in `:root {}`. Change the values as you prefer, choose between **rgb, hex and hsl**.  

BetterDiscord offers an in-app CSS code editor, feel free to use it as it is almost the same thing.

### Customizing from source üìë
If you want to make changes deeper than the previous methods, you can edit the `main.css` file in the same way. **Please note** that some changes might create conflicts or misfunctioning in the theme.


## Assistence üì•
If you encounter any problem, bug or anything feel free to reach me on _Discord_ and report it. I will fix everything as soon as possible. I also welcome every kind of suggestion, tip and critic that can help me improve my work.
